# Aetherworks Refracted
Aetherworks Refracted is an addon to Embers Rekindled that adds end-game content to the mod. The original 1.12.2 mod was made by V0idWa1k3r. (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aetherworks)

## Builds
Currently, there are no downloads available, as the porting is not yet complete. Once the mod is in a good usable state, downloads will be made available.

## Contact
You can contact me about the port in the Embers Rekindled discord, in the Embers channel, found here: https://discord.gg/SthsknG

## Port Changes:
- A variety of numbers changes and added config options.
- Removed or reworded many of the tooltips.
- Fixed block models in the inventory looking terrible.
- Aetherium refinement reworked as electrum and bronze no longer exists by default.
- Added the Aetherium Aspectus, required to perform aetherium-based alchemy.
- Added the Tool Forge, the final step in crafting aetherium tools, instead of just smushing the parts together in a crafting grid. (boring!)
- Added the "Moongaze" effect, dealing slow void damage over time. It is applied by aetherium weapons and by touching aetherium fluid. Can also be put into a vessel gem!
- Reworked the Pickaxe of the Molten Depths to veinmine a strip mine pattern and place glimmers as it does so. Removed its ability to drop geodes.
- Reworked the Axe of the Ancient Torrents into the Axe of the Sonorous Archives - it's now sculk themed, can vein mine leaves, and attempts to plant saplings from your inventory and grow them immediately in an area around you when continuously used. Also grows 2x2 trees like dark oak.
- Reworked the Shovel of the Perfect Machines into the Shovel of the Timeless Cascades - it's now prismarine themed and drains and places bodies of fluids, with a configurable capacity.
- Reworked the Crossbow of the Impending Doom into the Crossbow of the Stars Befall - it now excels at single target damage, dealing more damage the more times you hit the same enemy. It now shoots an ember projectile and applies Moongaze.
- Reworked the Crossbow of the Raging Volcano into the Crossbow of the Shattered Reflection - it now excels at crowd damage by shooting an ember ray that chains between nearby entities. It now applies Moongaze.
- Remade the crossbow models, they're now properly bulky.
- Fixed the vein-exchanging algorithm used by the Shovel of the Ineluctable Changes.
- Added the Tuning Cylinder and Aetheric Tuning augment, allowing any tool to drop geodes when breaking blocks.
- The Aetherium Crown now has a 3D model (with gem coloring), and has 3 application modes: Self (the wearer), Self & Friends (all players, animals, and npcs), and Hostiles (any hostile).
- Vessel gems now accept any potion, including those with multiple or custom effects (I.E. Turtle Master).
- Replaced aetherium ore with ancient aetherium meteorites whose old impact craters dot the landscape - search for their signature circular crater, or make an Aetheriometer, and you'll find them!
- Added Suevite, Cobbled Suevite, and Suevite bricks. Suevite is found in meteorites, and generated when aetherium aerosol meets water.

## Agenda
- Remake some of the old textures that no longer fit with modern minecraft's style.
- Write all the codex entries.

## Things I'm Thinking About Adding
- Add more decorative blocks. Because... decor!
- Allow upgrades (catalytic plug, wildfire stirling) to interact with the Aetherium Forge.
- Rework the heating and cooling of the Aetherium Forge so you'll want to use all 3 components, instead of just 1 heater + 2 heat vents.
- Add an aetherium shield that turns projectiles that hit it into ember projectiles that home towards whomever fired it.
- Add a pair of aetheric hoes that excel at farming and shepherding.
- Add more embers-based stuff, since the original mod didn't have a lot of actual integration.
- Semi-automatable Aetherium Forge (aka make automatic hammer work with certain forging recipes)
- Figure out how to animate the texture of the Aetherium Crown.
- Dangers from processing aetherium? Nothing annoying, of course.

## Musings
- What is Aetherium, anyway? Ember is something like the fire or energy of the core of the planet, and Aetherium is generated via moonlight, and moonlight comes from the sun reflecting off the moon, so Aetherium is the ember reflections of the sun with special moon stuff thrown in. I imagine that, coming from the sun near-directly, it's very powerful and that working with and harnessing it is challenging.
- How would the addition of Mithril to base Embers affect Aetherworks' progression and tool strength? Mithril has downsides and loosely does similar things to the aetherium tools, so how should they be distinguished? Maybe as opposites or something? Make Aetherium make you sick as well?
- Aetherium's properties in the materials document in the Embers github are "Refractive, Reflective, Ember", based on what Aetherium is as a material - it forms crystal shards that absorb and distort light, as well as ember. However, I believe it's ability to contain ember is much more limited than ember crystals themselves - it'd rather refract it away than trap it.
- In the ancient civilization, what was aetherium's role? Did they harness it or shun it? Not enough information (or content) on the ancients yet, so I cannot decide.
- What is up with the moon? Nothing good, but nothing evil. Probably.
