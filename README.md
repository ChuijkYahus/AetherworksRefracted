# Aetherworks Refracted
Aetherworks Refracted is an addon to Embers Rekindled that adds end-game content to the mod. The original 1.12.2 mod was made by V0idWa1k3r. (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aetherworks)

## Builds
Currently, there are no downloads available, as the porting is not yet complete. Once the mod is in a good usable state, downloads will be made available.

## Contact
You can contact me about the port in the Embers Rekindled discord, in the Embers channel, found here: https://discord.gg/SthsknG

## Port Changes:
- A variety of numbers changes and added config options.
- Removed or reworded many of the tooltips.
- Fixed block models in the inventory not looking good.
- Added the Aetherium Aspectus, required to perform aetherium-based alchemy.
- Reworked the Pickaxe of the Molten Depths to veinmine a strip mine pattern and place glimmers as it does so. Removed its ability to drop geodes.
- Reworked the Axe of the Ancient Torrents into the Axe of the Sonorous Archives - it's now sculk themed, can vein mine leaves, and attempts to plant saplings from your inventory and grow them immediately in an area around you when continuously used. Also grows 2x2 trees like dark oak.
- Added the Tuning Cylinder and Aetheric Tuning augment, allowing any tool to drop geodes when breaking blocks.
- The Aetherium Crown now has a 3D model (with gem coloring), and has 3 application modes: Self (the wearer), Self & Friends (all players, animals, and npcs), and Hostiles (any hostile).
- Potion gems now accept any potion, including those with multiple effects (I.E. Turtle Master).
- Added Suevite, Cobbled Suevite, and Suevite bricks. Suevite can be found in meteorites and occasionally obtained from geodes.

## Agenda
- Finish porting all the tools and their functionalities.
- Rework several of the aetheric tools, because some of them are super bland. (The crossbows, ember pick, redstone shovel, prismarine axe)
- Remake some of the old textures that no longer fit with modern minecraft's style.
- Add a tool station to the Aetherium Forge for crafting your tool parts together into the final tool.
- Remove Aetherium Ore as it originally existed, and instead have it spawn in small suevite meteorite structures.
- Add a larger underground meteorite that contains a special metal seed that grows items that are required in the tool station to finish tools.
- Add a section to the Ancient Codex, "Reflections of the Sun", that contains Aetherworks stuff.

## Things I'm Thinking About Adding
- Add more decorative blocks. Because... decor!
- Rework the heating and cooling of the Aetherium Forge so you'll want to use all 3 components, instead of just 1 heater + 2 heat vents.
- Add an aetherium shield that turns projectiles that hit it into ember projectiles that home towards whomever fired it.
- Add a pair of aetheric hoes that excel at farming and shepherding.
- Add more embers-based stuff, since the original mod didn't have a lot of actual integration.
- Semi-automatable Aetherium Forge (aka make automatic hammer work with certain forging recipes)
- Figure out how to animate the texture of the Aetherium Crown.
- Maybe add a scary strong mob to the ancient meteorite for a bit of challenge? There's not much combat stuff in Embers or Aetherworks, after all.

## Musings
- What is Aetherium, anyway? Well, Ember is something like the fire or energy of the core of the planet, and Aetherium is generated via moonlight, and moonlight comes from the sun reflecting off the moon, so Aetherium is the ember reflections of the sun with special moon stuff thrown in. I imagine that, coming from the sun near-directly, it's very powerful and that working with and harnessing it is challenging.
- How would the addition of Mithril to base Embers affect Aetherworks' progression and tool strength? Mithril has downsides and loosely does similar things to the aetherium tools, so how should they be distinguished? Maybe as opposites or something? Make Aetherium make you sick as well?
- I imagine Aetherium's properties in the materials document in the Embers github are "Refractive, Reflective, Ember", based on what Aetherium is as a material - it forms crystal shards that absorb and distort light, as well as ember.
